## Hi, I'm Beto Oliveira! 👋
I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Aveiro seeking an environment in which I can grow professionally as a software engineer, apply my coding skills, and contribute to creating innovative projects.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
Since one of my favorite areas is artificial intelligence, I try to learn more about it, from image creation to machine learning.
I am currently not learning any specific language.

## 🎯 Interests
* 📱 Tech: Artificial intelligence.
* 🎮 Hobbies: I'm a sportsman, playing football every week. I also like to spend time playing games, watching anime and even cosplaying. 
* 🐱 My lovely cat Mirtilo couldn't go without a honor mention!
